				<h3><b>Education</b></h3>
				<p>I am a rising Junior at the University of Notre Dame, and majoring in computer science with a minor in data science. I am from Lake Bluff, Illinois and attended Lake Forest High School prior to coming to South Bend. Before becoming a computer science major, I was a chemical engineering major for the entiretity of my freshman year.<br><br>Over the course of my spring semester freshman year, I took my first coding course and fell in love with it. I loved how you could start with a blank page, and turn it into whatever you wanted, I loved the creation aspect to it. Over the following summer, I taught myself new languages, and quickly realized that I could see a career path starting to take form.</p>

				<h3><b>Family</b></h3>
				<p>As mentioned above, I am from Lake Bluff, Illinois, I live with my parents, along with my younger brother, younger sister, and golden retriever, Scout. My brother will be a freshman at Notre Dame next year, and my sister will be a junior in high school. Both my parents attended Notre Dame, and met during their time on campus, so we are absolutley the stereotypical Notre Dame family!</p>

				<h3><b>Interests</b></h3>
				<p>In my free time, I am the vice preisdent of the Mens Club Ice Hockey team, so when I am not working on homework, I am usually on the ice. As vice president, I work closley with our faculty adivsor, and other members of our executive board to plan trips, and schedule home and away games. Some of our best away games include Michigan, Miami (FL), and Tampa.<br><br>In addition to club hockey, I am also a member of CS for Good, in the Websites for Non-Profits division. As the name implies, it is a small group of computer science students, and we use our knowledge of website developmment to help local non-profits in the area get websites up and running. In addition to helping me learn the skills needed for proficient website development (HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JS), this club also provides us with opportunites to get involved in the South Bend Area.<br><br>Finally, I am a member of the Explore, Excite, Engage (EEE), club on campus. We work with local high schools to get their students excited about college. Some of the students in South Bend high schools often think that Notre Dame is their only options, due purely to vicinity, but we help them find other schools that may be better suited for them. We help with after school tutoring, along with essay editing.</p>
